Simple-Storefront is a project of Blake Montgomery, a web developer based in Chicago.
The initial repo was created on Nov 11, 2021.
This is a learning, and hopefully eventually a showcase, project. 
The subject is a remake of the "Marketplace of Ideas" app I originally created during General Assembly. It was a simple exploration of linking a database to a backend server and template pages. The original was built in Node/Express and used Mongoose to connect to a MongoDB instance.
This current version will be a Flask app written in Python and eventually using a PostgreSQL database.
While I have ideas for exploring e-commerce and other functionalities, the initial aim is to use this project to explore some new concepts in testing and to lean into a TDD workflow.
